Utilizing Tools for Keyword Research

Most frequently used tool are :
1) Google term Planner: Provides data on term trends, competitiveness, and search traffic.

2) Ahrefs: Offers an in-depth analysis of keyword ranks, competition, and related terms.

3) SEMrush: Offers assistance with competition analysis, search volume, and keyword suggestions. The only thing is it is really expensive.

I Have used google term planner for this.
